# Manybody_physics_project
Computational project for the exam of the course "Introduction to manybody physics" (UniTs)

With this little project I put  in practice the basic formalism used to describe solid state systems studied throughout the course, along with a practical implementation of the simplest (hamiltonian) diagonalization techniques employed in computational physics. Furthermore, foundations have been laid for a possible investigation (already present in literature) of more complex models with rather immediate consequences in the study of strongly interacting electron systems, such as superconductors.
